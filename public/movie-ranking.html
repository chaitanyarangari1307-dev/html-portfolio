<h2>My Top Three Movies Recommendations</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    This Film's ending is one of the most satisfying I've ever seen.<br />
    This film's story is about freindship, hope and freedom which will really make you emotional at the end.
</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I like how this film deals with masculanity and materealism at the same time.<br />But Out of all I really like how it deals with man's inner thought and personality.</p>

<h3>Oldboy</h3>
<p>
    This Film's dark tone and plot twist is one of the best in the cinema history.<br />
    The Film's story revolves around revenge and touches the dark psyche of the Human mind.
